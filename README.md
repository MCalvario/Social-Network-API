# Social-Network-API

## Description
Aa a fullstack developer, I want an API for  social networks that use a NoSQL database so that the website can handle large amounts of unstructured data.

## Usage
To use this social network API, enter the command to invoke the application and your server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database.  When you open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.  When you test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia, then you are able to  successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database.  When you test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia, you are able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list.
